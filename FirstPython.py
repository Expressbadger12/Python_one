print("Print is a command that can be used to make the terminal output anything you want")

print("To print text you write 'print' then inside parenthesis you write what you want to print. If you want to print a string, you'll have to put it in quotes")

print("Here is an example of the output of 'print(\"example text\")'")

print("example text")

print("fun little fact:  I had to use a backslash before the quotation marks in the line that showed what command I was going to run because the code thought I was closing the first quotation marks. This is called 'escaping' characters.")

print("You can also print datastructures that arn't strings like integers by entering them in without quotes such as 'print(4)'")

print(4)
