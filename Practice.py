# Let's use the print function and have some fun

# Getting to know the print function
# The print() function takes whatever you give it and shows it in the terminal
# In this example, we are giving it a string. A string is tezt inside quotes.
print("Example 1: Hello world!")
print ("Example 2: My name is Boone and I love music")

#Now we can use variables
#Definition: where you can store information in variables so thatt you can reuse it
#Let's create some variations
animal = "whale"
habitat = "ocean"
food = "krill"

print("My favorite animal is:", animal)
print("What does a whale eat?", food)
print("Where does the whale live?", habitat)
